Timeloop/Accelergy Tutorial
===========================

The exercises/ directory contains a set of exercises to
explore both Timeloop and Accelergy.

To try out a simple example do the following:

```
    cd  exercises/timeloop/01-model-conv1d-1level
    timeloop-model *.yaml
    cat *.map.txt
```

If you are using a new Docker container and want to update the exercises. 
Then when running the container, type:

```
       % refresh-exercises
```

Note, to skip this intro:

```
    touch ~/.nointro
```
